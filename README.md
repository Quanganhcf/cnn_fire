Convolutional neural network to detect fire


My Master Thesis.

This is a set of scripts that allow you to train a Convolutional neural network based on the raw images placed on the images directory.

It works on one raspberry pi.

Raspbery pi will get the weights from google drive where the trainer machine will upload them.

User can see streammingm video thought web and control pan&tilt. 

Also not seen here, system is autosuficient in terms of energy.
